# Cost-calculation-of-rental-cars

## Introduction


- In our project we use FLOYDâ€™S WARSHALL ALGORITHM to solve the given map.
- This algorithm is used to solve the map to find all pair shortest path problem.
- In this project we solve bidirectional map.
- We are calculating  total distance from starting point to ending point and calculating their cost/KM.
